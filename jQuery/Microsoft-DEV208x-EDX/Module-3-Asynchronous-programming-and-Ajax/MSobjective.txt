OBJECTIVE:

For module three, you'll add the final feature to your rating widget: 
the ability to send the rating to a service.

The service has already been created. The service will act as a simple 
echo service, taking the rating you submit inside a JSON object, and 
then sending back a JSON containing a message. The structure of the 
expected JSON object, and the JSON object the service will return, 
are documented below.

To complete the lab, follow these steps:

Update the HTML you used to complete lab two.

Add a button. You will use the new button to submit the rating to 
the Rating service. You can use the HTML below:
  <button type="button" id="save-rating">Save rating</button>
  
Add a div element. You will use the new div element to output the 
message. You can use the HTML below:
  <div id="output"></div>
  
Add a click event handler for the button you created. Add the code 
necessary to call the Rating service. The information about the rating 
service, including the URL, the verb, and the JSON objects, is below.
When the server returns the object, display the message inside of the 
div you created earlier.

VERB: POST

Parameter (object to upload): The server expects a JSON object with two 
properties, value, which contains the current rating, and maxValue, 
which contains the maximum allowed value. (Example: { value: 4, 
maxValue: 5})

Return (object returned by server): The server will return a JSON object
with one property, message which will contain the message returned by the 
server. (Example: {message: 'You chose 4 out of 5'}
