OBJECTIVE:

For module two, you will enhance the interface for your review widget. 
The updated interface must meet the following goals

Provide a configurable number of circles for the user to click on. This 
can be accomplished by adding a custom attribute to the outer div element 
that contains the circles.

Allow the number of circles to be updated by a textbox. This is to simulate 
an administration widget; we will not be adding any form of security to the 
widget.

The existing functionality of hovering and selection must still work.
The starting ratings widget will have 5 circles.

When a user enters a new value into the textbox, the number of circles must
contain the number provided.

Tip: Delegate, which we talked about previously, does not support the hover 
event.
