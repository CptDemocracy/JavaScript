Microsoft DEV208x "Introduction to jQuery" EDX course on edx.org

PLEASE NOTE. The course provided additional code that came bundled
with labs. For that reason, in order to allow readers of this 
repository to distiguish the code that is authored by developers
at Microsoft and my code, I use a special naming convention, as
follows.

All Microsoft-supplied code that I didn't write myself, is 
prefixed with "MS".
