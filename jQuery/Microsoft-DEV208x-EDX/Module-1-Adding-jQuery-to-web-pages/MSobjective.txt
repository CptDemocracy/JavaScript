OBJECTIVE:

For module one, you will create the initial interface for 
your review widget. The interface must meet the following goals:

Provide five circles for the user to select or click on.

When the user hovers their mouse over a circle, that circle 
and all circles to the left must be filled with a color, such 
as yellow. You can see a screenshot of this below.

When the user clicks on a circle, that circle and all circles 
to the left must be filled with a different color, such as green. 
The color must remain, even after the user moves their mouse away 
from the widget. You do not need to remember the number for page 
refreshes. You can see a sample of this below.

HTML and CSS for the interface has been provided for your use. 
The lab can be solved without using any additional HTML; 
you only need to provide the necessary jQuery.
